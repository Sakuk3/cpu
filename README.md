## Description
This is an attempt to build a CPU from scratch; first in Logisim and then with ICs.
CPU.circ is the version before implementing the memory device bus, CPU_2.circ is the newer version which also implements pointer manipulation as well as conditional skip for branching.

## Instructions
Instructions consist of an 8 bit argument followed by the 8 bit command. The usage of the argument depends on the context.
